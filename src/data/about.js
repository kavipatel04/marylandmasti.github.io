  title: "What is Garba?",
  text: "Garba is a popular folk dance native to the state of Gujarat, located in Western India. Traditionally, it is performed during a 9 day festival called Navratri (Nav = 9, Ratri = nights). Navratri is predominately a celebration in honor of Goddess Amba, as well as other popular Hindu gods and goddesses. It occurs in mid to late October, depending on the lunar calendar, and is divided into three sets of three days to worship different reincarnations of the Goddess Amba. The first three days are for Durga, the destroyer of all vices and impurities. The next three days are for Lakshmi, the bestower of wealth. The last three days are for Saraswati, the imparter of knowledge and wisdom. During Garba, a portrait of the goddess with a lit flame in front of her is placed in the center of the circle. People then dance around the deity clapping rhythmically to the accompanying music. This traditional form has transformed into the modern form of Garba that we see today",
